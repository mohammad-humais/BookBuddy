# BookBuddy

BookBuddy is a personal book tracking website developed using React.js, designed to help users manage their reading progress and organize their bookshelf. Here are the key functionalities:

**Login/Signup:** Users can create an account or log in to access their bookshelf and track their reading progress.

**Bookshelf Sections:** The home page features three sections:
    (i) Currently Reading: Displays books that the user is currently reading.
    (ii) Completed: Shows books that the user has finished reading.
    (iii) Planning to Read: Lists books that the user plans to read in the future.

**Book Status Management:** Users can easily change the status of a book:
Mark as Currently Reading: Move a book from any section to "Currently Reading" when they start reading it.
Mark as Completed: Change the status of a book from "Currently Reading" or "Planning to Read" to "Completed" when they finish reading it.
Mark as Planning to Read: Add new books to the bookshelf and mark them as "Planning to Read" upon addition.
  
**Adding New Books:** Users can add new books to their bookshelf, specifying the book's title, author, and optionally, its cover image. During the addition process, users can also select the current status of the book as "Planning to Read," "Currently Reading," or "Completed."

**Removing/Deleting Books:** Users have the option to remove or delete books from any section of their bookshelf. This allows them to declutter their book list or remove books they no longer wish to track.
